A repository where I organized several ways of using Flexbox on CSS, explaining how tow use Flexbox, how to justify contents and how to align items. It was created based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJn-XAlsuvY) presented by [Fernanda Kipper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernanda-kipper/).

Created by [Tiago Zanarde](https://tiagozanarde.dev) using the tutorial mentioned before.
